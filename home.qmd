-   The great [Florian Oswald](https://floswald.github.io) teaching material at Sciences Po. Do not hesitate to check his teaching material (in English) 

-   The [tutorials](https://mtes-mct.github.io/parcours-r/) of the French Ministry of Ecology (in French) 
-   The infamous online book [Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org) (in English)
