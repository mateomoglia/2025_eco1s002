    "text": "First step in R\n\nOpen a script\nR has built-in functions but most useful functions should be called using libraries. These libraries should be first downloaded then loaded into your project.\nFirst, open RStudio and opens a new script. You should have an empty page. You may want to write some words at the top of it to have an idea of what this code does. You can use # to comment code.\n\n#_______________________________________\n# This script opens a dataset and proceeds\n# to data visualization.\n#\n# Author: Matéo Moglia\n# Date: 12/02/2025\n#_______________________________________\n\nsetwd(\"/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2025_eco1s002/site/2025_eco1s002\")\npath &lt;- \"/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2025_eco1s002/site/2025_eco1s002\"\n\nHere, I set the working directory and create an object called path using the &lt;- operator. I will be able to call my path thanks to this object instead of typing the path everytime I need it.\n\n\nOur first data\nWe can load a built-in dataframe, the iris dataset, into an object called data.\n\ndata &lt;- iris\nclass(data)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nhead(data)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\n\nData description\nBy clicking on the object in the Environement panel, I can visualize it. I can also write some code to describe it:\n\ntable(data$Species)\n\n\n    setosa versicolor  virginica \n        50         50         50 \n\nsummary(data$Sepal.Length)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  4.300   5.100   5.800   5.843   6.400   7.900 \n\n\nHere, I use the table function to have a frequency table of the variable Species and the function summary to compute summary statistics of the variable Sepal.Length.\nNow, I want to visualize the data. To do so, we can use base R function plot:\n\nplot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first graph!\nWe can also use a very popular library for dataviz, ggplot2. First, we install it, then we load it, and we are going to be able to use it.\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\",repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll packages have to be downloaded and loaded this way. Note that once you’ve downloaded a package on your computer, you do not need to install it but you still need to load it through the library function.\n\n\n\ng1 &lt;- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\ng1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks better! To produce this graph we used different information:\n\nThe ggplot command takes data and mapping as input.\n\ndata should be the dataset you want to visualize, here we named it data\nmapping takes aes (for aesthetics)\n\nHere, the aesthetics are the x and y axis, and the color one, to distinguish between the species.\n\ngeom_point allows to plot… points\ntheme_minimal makes the graph tidy, with a white background, etc.\n\n\nNow, we can save it:\n\nggsave(filename = paste0(path,\"/output/graph_iris.png\"),plot = g1)\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe function paste0 is useful to concatenate text. Here, instead of writing the full path, we concatenate the object path (which happens to be our path) and the end of the path, including the name of the output.\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\nTo finish this -short- introduction to R, I introduce a new package, probably the most popular one in R: dplyr. As before, we install then load the library.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nLet’s imagine we want to filter the dataset to keep only the setosa. In base R, we need to extract the lines of iris for which Species==\"setosa\". Because R is object based, we can multiple objects, here: base_setosa.\n\nThe data frame iris is close to a matrix, hence, we can extract using notations close to the matrix ones. Hence data[1,1] would give us the first line of the first column (in this order) of data. Here, we filt the lines using a condition: data$Species==\"setosa\". Do not forget the ,.\n\n\n# Base R: Filter rows where Species is \"setosa\"\nbase_setosa &lt;- data[data$Species == \"setosa\", ]\nhead(base_setosa)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nUsing dplyr and the pipe operator %&gt;%, we apply the function filter on Species.\n\n# dplyr: Filter rows where Species is \"setosa\"\ndplyr_setosa &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  filter(Species == \"setosa\")\nhead(dplyr_setosa)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nNext, we can select specific columns.\n\n# Base R: Select only Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width columns\nbase_columns &lt;- iris[, c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\")]\nhead(base_columns)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n6          5.4         3.9\n\n# dplyr: Select only Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width columns\ndplyr_columns &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)\nhead(dplyr_columns)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n6          5.4         3.9\n\n\n\n# Base R: Create a new column with Sepal.Area (Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\niris$Sepal.Area &lt;- iris$Sepal.Length * iris$Sepal.Width\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Sepal.Area\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa      17.85\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa      14.70\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa      15.04\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa      14.26\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa      18.00\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa      21.06\n\n# dplyr: Create a new column with Sepal.Area (Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\ndplyr_iris &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\nhead(dplyr_iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Sepal.Area\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa      17.85\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa      14.70\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa      15.04\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa      14.26\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa      18.00\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa      21.06\n\n\nThe advantage of dplyr is to allow for many computations:\n\ndplyr_grouped &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width) %&gt;%\n  mutate(is.Sepal.Large = ifelse(Sepal.Area &gt; median(Sepal.Area),1,0)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Species) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n            count_sepal_large = sum(is.Sepal.Large))\nprint(dplyr_grouped)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  Species    mean_sepal_length count_sepal_large\n  &lt;fct&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 setosa                  5.01                21\n2 versicolor              5.94                18\n3 virginica               6.59                36\n\n\nThis dataset can be, of course represented visually:\n\nggplot(dplyr_grouped, aes(x = Species, y = count_sepal_large, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Sepal Count by Species\",\n       x = \"Species\", y = \"Count of large sepals\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also export it to LaTeX:\n\ninstall.packages(\"xtable\")\nlibrary(xtable)\n\n\ncolnames(dplyr_grouped) &lt;- c(\"Species\", \"Mean_Sepal_Length\", \"Count_Sepal_Large\")\nprint(xtable(dplyr_grouped), type = \"latex\", file = paste0(path,\"/output/sepal_large.tex\"))",

    "text": "The Solow model\nThe Solow growth model (SGM) seeks to explain economic growth taking the rates of saving \\(s\\), population growth \\(n\\) and technological progress \\(g\\) as exogenous (given outside the model). We assume a Cobb-Douglas production function, so output \\(Y\\) at time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[\nY(t) = K(t)^{\\alpha} ( A(t) L(t) )^{1-\\alpha}, \\text{ for } \\alpha \\in (0,1)\n\\]\nThe notation is standard: \\(Y\\) is output, \\(K\\) capital, \\(L\\) labor, and \\(A\\) the level of technology. In this production function, technological change is labor augmenting which is known as “Harrod-neutral”. \\(L\\) and \\(A\\) are assumed to grow exogenously at rates \\(n\\) and \\(g\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL(t) = L(0) e^{nt} \\\\\nA(t) = A(0) e^{gt}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe number of effective units of labor, \\(A(t) L(t) = A(0) L(0) e^{(n+g) t}\\) grows at rate \\(n+g\\). We will assume perfect competition, so the two inputs, capital and labor are paid their marginal products.\nThe model assumes that a constant fraction of output, \\(s\\) , is invested. The remaining output is consumed. We define \\(k\\) as the stock of capital per effective unit of labor,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk(t) \\equiv \\frac{K(t)}{A(t) L(t) }\n\\end{align*}\n\\] and \\(y\\) as the level of output per effective unit of labor,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny(t) &= \\frac{Y(t) }{A(t) L(t)} \\\\\n&= K(t)^{\\alpha} ( A(t) L(t) )^{- \\alpha} \\\\\n&= \\left(  \\frac{ K(t) } { ( A(t) L(t) ) } \\right)^{\\alpha} \\\\\n&= k(t)^{\\alpha}\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The evolution of \\(k\\) is governed by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{k}(t) & = s y(t) - (n+ g + \\delta) k(t) \\\\\n& = s k(t)^{\\alpha} - (n+ g + \\delta) k(t) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(\\delta \\in (0,1)\\) is the rate of capital depreciation. My intuition for this comes from the discrete version: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{ k(t+1) }_{ \\text{capital tomorrow} } = \\underbrace{ s k(t)^{\\alpha} }_{ \\text{ output saved} } +  \\underbrace{ (1 - (n+g + \\delta) ) k(t)}_{ \\text{output not depreciated} }\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIf we take the limit of \\(k(t + \\Delta ) - k(t)\\) as \\(\\Delta \\to 0\\), we get (2.4). The steady state is defined to be the level of capital \\(k^{ss}\\) at which \\(\\dot{k}(t) = 0\\), plugging this into equation (2.4) we have: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0 = s (k^{ss})^{\\alpha} - (n+ g + \\delta) (k^{ss})\n\\end{align*}\n\\] which implies \\[\n\\begin{align}\nk^{ss} = \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} }\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now plugging in: \\[\n\\begin{align}\ny^{ss} &= (k^{ss})^{\\alpha} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{ Y(t) }{ A(t) L(t) } &= \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} } \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{ Y(t) }{ L(t) } &= A(0) e^{gt} \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} } \\nonumber \\\\\n\\log\\left( \\frac{ Y(t) }{ L(t) } \\right)&= \\log(A(0) ) + gt  + \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(s)  -  \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(n + g + \\delta)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Equation (2.6) gives us an expression for steady-state income per-capita. Since capital’s share in income \\(\\alpha\\) is roughly one third, the model implies elasticity of income per capita with respect to saving rate \\(\\varepsilon_{ \\frac{Y}{L}  , s} = \\frac{d \\log( \\frac{Y}{L}  )}{ d \\log(s) } = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx  \\frac{ \\frac{1}{3} }{ \\frac{2}{3} } = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and an elasticity with respect to \\((n+g+\\delta)\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{ \\frac{Y}{L}  , s} = \\frac{d \\log( \\frac{Y}{L}  )}{ d \\log(n+g+\\delta) } = - \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx - \\frac{ \\frac{1}{3} }{ \\frac{2}{3} } = - \\frac{1}{2}\\).",
