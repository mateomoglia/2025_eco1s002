    "text": "First step in R\n\nOpen a script\nR has built-in functions but most useful functions should be called using libraries. These libraries should be first downloaded then loaded into your project.\nFirst, open RStudio and opens a new script. You should have an empty page. You may want to write some words at the top of it to have an idea of what this code does. You can use # to comment code.\n\n#_______________________________________\n# This script opens a dataset and proceeds\n# to data visualization.\n#\n# Author: Matéo Moglia\n# Date: 12/02/2025\n#_______________________________________\n\nsetwd(\"/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2025_eco1s002/site/2025_eco1s002\")\npath &lt;- \"/Users/mmoglia/Dropbox/courses/polytechnique/2025_eco1s002/site/2025_eco1s002\"\n\nHere, I set the working directory and create an object called path using the &lt;- operator. I will be able to call my path thanks to this object instead of typing the path everytime I need it.\n\n\nOur first data\nWe can load a built-in dataframe, the iris dataset, into an object called data.\n\ndata &lt;- iris\nclass(data)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nhead(data)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\n\nData description\nBy clicking on the object in the Environement panel, I can visualize it. I can also write some code to describe it:\n\ntable(data$Species)\n\n\n    setosa versicolor  virginica \n        50         50         50 \n\nsummary(data$Sepal.Length)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  4.300   5.100   5.800   5.843   6.400   7.900 \n\n\nHere, I use the table function to have a frequency table of the variable Species and the function summary to compute summary statistics of the variable Sepal.Length.\nNow, I want to visualize the data. To do so, we can use base R function plot:\n\nplot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Sepal.Width)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first graph!\nWe can also use a very popular library for dataviz, ggplot2. First, we install it, then we load it, and we are going to be able to use it.\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\",repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll packages have to be downloaded and loaded this way. Note that once you’ve downloaded a package on your computer, you do not need to install it but you still need to load it through the library function.\n\n\n\ng1 &lt;- ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\ng1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks better! To produce this graph we used different information:\n\nThe ggplot command takes data and mapping as input.\n\ndata should be the dataset you want to visualize, here we named it data\nmapping takes aes (for aesthetics)\n\nHere, the aesthetics are the x and y axis, and the color one, to distinguish between the species.\n\ngeom_point allows to plot… points\ntheme_minimal makes the graph tidy, with a white background, etc.\n\n\nNow, we can save it:\n\nggsave(filename = paste0(path,\"/output/graph_iris.png\"),plot = g1)\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe function paste0 is useful to concatenate text. Here, instead of writing the full path, we concatenate the object path (which happens to be our path) and the end of the path, including the name of the output.\n\n\n\n\nData manipulation\nTo finish this -short- introduction to R, I introduce a new package, probably the most popular one in R: dplyr. As before, we install then load the library.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nLet’s imagine we want to filter the dataset to keep only the setosa. In base R, we need to extract the lines of iris for which Species==\"setosa\". Because R is object based, we can multiple objects, here: base_setosa.\n\nThe data frame iris is close to a matrix, hence, we can extract using notations close to the matrix ones. Hence data[1,1] would give us the first line of the first column (in this order) of data. Here, we filt the lines using a condition: data$Species==\"setosa\". Do not forget the ,.\n\n\n# Base R: Filter rows where Species is \"setosa\"\nbase_setosa &lt;- data[data$Species == \"setosa\", ]\nhead(base_setosa)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nUsing dplyr and the pipe operator %&gt;%, we apply the function filter on Species.\n\n# dplyr: Filter rows where Species is \"setosa\"\ndplyr_setosa &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  filter(Species == \"setosa\")\nhead(dplyr_setosa)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nNext, we can select specific columns.\n\n# Base R: Select only Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width columns\nbase_columns &lt;- iris[, c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\")]\nhead(base_columns)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n6          5.4         3.9\n\n# dplyr: Select only Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width columns\ndplyr_columns &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)\nhead(dplyr_columns)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n6          5.4         3.9\n\n\n\n# Base R: Create a new column with Sepal.Area (Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\niris$Sepal.Area &lt;- iris$Sepal.Length * iris$Sepal.Width\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Sepal.Area\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa      17.85\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa      14.70\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa      15.04\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa      14.26\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa      18.00\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa      21.06\n\n# dplyr: Create a new column with Sepal.Area (Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\ndplyr_iris &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\nhead(dplyr_iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Sepal.Area\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa      17.85\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa      14.70\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa      15.04\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa      14.26\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa      18.00\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa      21.06\n\n\nThe advantage of dplyr is to allow for many computations:\n\ndplyr_grouped &lt;- iris %&gt;%\n  mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width) %&gt;%\n  mutate(is.Sepal.Large = ifelse(Sepal.Area &gt; median(Sepal.Area),1,0)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Species) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n            count_sepal_large = sum(is.Sepal.Large))\nprint(dplyr_grouped)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  Species    mean_sepal_length count_sepal_large\n  &lt;fct&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 setosa                  5.01                21\n2 versicolor              5.94                18\n3 virginica               6.59                36\n\n\nThis dataset can be, of course represented visually:\n\nggplot(dplyr_grouped, aes(x = Species, y = count_sepal_large, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Sepal Count by Species\",\n       x = \"Species\", y = \"Count of large sepals\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also export it to LaTeX:\n\ninstall.packages(\"xtable\")\nlibrary(xtable)\n\n\ncolnames(dplyr_grouped) &lt;- c(\"Species\", \"Mean_Sepal_Length\", \"Count_Sepal_Large\")\nprint(xtable(dplyr_grouped), type = \"latex\", file = paste0(path,\"/output/sepal_large.tex\"))",

    "text": "The Solow model\nThe Solow growth model (SGM) seeks to explain economic growth taking the rates of saving \\(s\\), population growth \\(n\\) and technological progress \\(g\\) as exogenous (given outside the model). We assume a Cobb-Douglas production function, so output \\(Y\\) at time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[\nY(t) = K(t)^{\\alpha} ( A(t) L(t) )^{1-\\alpha}, \\text{ for } \\alpha \\in (0,1)\n\\]\nThe notation is standard: \\(Y\\) is output, \\(K\\) capital, \\(L\\) labor, and \\(A\\) the level of technology. In this production function, technological change is labor augmenting which is known as “Harrod-neutral”. \\(L\\) and \\(A\\) are assumed to grow exogenously at rates \\(n\\) and \\(g\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nL(t) = L(0) e^{nt} \\\\\nA(t) = A(0) e^{gt}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe number of effective units of labor, \\(A(t) L(t) = A(0) L(0) e^{(n+g) t}\\) grows at rate \\(n+g\\). We will assume perfect competition, so the two inputs, capital and labor are paid their marginal products.\nThe model assumes that a constant fraction of output, \\(s\\) , is invested. The remaining output is consumed. We define \\(k\\) as the stock of capital per effective unit of labor,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk(t) \\equiv \\frac{K(t)}{A(t) L(t) }\n\\end{align*}\n\\] and \\(y\\) as the level of output per effective unit of labor,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny(t) &= \\frac{Y(t) }{A(t) L(t)} \\\\\n&= K(t)^{\\alpha} ( A(t) L(t) )^{- \\alpha} \\\\\n&= \\left(  \\frac{ K(t) } { ( A(t) L(t) ) } \\right)^{\\alpha} \\\\\n&= k(t)^{\\alpha}\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The evolution of \\(k\\) is governed by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{k}(t) & = s y(t) - (n+ g + \\delta) k(t) \\\\\n& = s k(t)^{\\alpha} - (n+ g + \\delta) k(t) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(\\delta \\in (0,1)\\) is the rate of capital depreciation. My intuition for this comes from the discrete version: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{ k(t+1) }_{ \\text{capital tomorrow} } = \\underbrace{ s k(t)^{\\alpha} }_{ \\text{ output saved} } +  \\underbrace{ (1 - (n+g + \\delta) ) k(t)}_{ \\text{output not depreciated} }\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIf we take the limit of \\(k(t + \\Delta ) - k(t)\\) as \\(\\Delta \\to 0\\), we get (2.4). The steady state is defined to be the level of capital \\(k^{ss}\\) at which \\(\\dot{k}(t) = 0\\), plugging this into equation (2.4) we have: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0 = s (k^{ss})^{\\alpha} - (n+ g + \\delta) (k^{ss})\n\\end{align*}\n\\] which implies \\[\n\\begin{align}\nk^{ss} = \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} }\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now plugging in: \\[\n\\begin{align}\ny^{ss} &= (k^{ss})^{\\alpha} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{ Y(t) }{ A(t) L(t) } &= \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} } \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{ Y(t) }{ L(t) } &= A(0) e^{gt} \\left(  \\frac{s}{ n + g + \\delta } \\right)^{ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} } \\nonumber \\\\\n\\log\\left( \\frac{ Y(t) }{ L(t) } \\right)&= \\log(A(0) ) + gt  + \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(s)  -  \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(n + g + \\delta)\n\\end{align}\n\\] Equation (2.6) gives us an expression for steady-state income per-capita. Since capital’s share in income \\(\\alpha\\) is roughly one third, the model implies elasticity of income per capita with respect to saving rate \\(\\varepsilon_{ \\frac{Y}{L}  , s} = \\frac{d \\log( \\frac{Y}{L}  )}{ d \\log(s) } = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx  \\frac{ \\frac{1}{3} }{ \\frac{2}{3} } = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and an elasticity with respect to \\((n+g+\\delta)\\) \\(\\varepsilon_{ \\frac{Y}{L}  , s} = \\frac{d \\log( \\frac{Y}{L}  )}{ d \\log(n+g+\\delta) } = - \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\approx - \\frac{ \\frac{1}{3} }{ \\frac{2}{3} } = - \\frac{1}{2}\\).",

We want to see if the data support this prediction.\n\nEconometrics model\nWe assume that the growth rate of technology \\(g\\) and the rate of capital depreciation \\(\\delta\\) are constant across countries. In contrast the term \\(A_0\\) reflects not only the level of technology, but also resource endowments, climate, institutions and so on. It may differ across countries, so we assume that \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log(A_0 ) = a + \\varepsilon\n\\end{align*}\n\\] where \\(a\\) is a constant and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a country specific shock. Thus log income per capita (at time \\(0\\)) is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\log\\left( \\frac{ Y }{ L } \\right)&= a  + \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(s)  -  \\left(  \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right) \\log(n + g + \\delta) + \\varepsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis last equation is our basic empirical specification in this section. We assume that \\(s\\) and \\(n\\) are independent of \\(\\varepsilon\\), so our regressors are exogenous. This implies we can estimate this equation with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n\n\nData\nThe data are from the Real National Accounts constructed by Summers and Heston (1988). It includes real income, government and private consumption, investment, and population for almost all of the world except the centrally planned economies. The data are annual and cover 1960-1985.\n\nThe population growth rate \\(n\\) is measured as the average rate of growth of the working age population, where working age is defined as 15-64.\nThe savings rate \\(s\\) is measured as the average real investment (including government investment) in real GDP, and \\(Y/L\\) as real GDP in 1985 divided by the working age population in that year.\n\nMankiw, Romer and Weil consider three samples:\n\nThe most comprehensive consists of all countries for which data are available other than those for which oil production is the dominant industry. This sample consists of 98 countries. MRW exclude the oil producers because the bulk of recorded GDP for these countries represents the extraction of existing resources, not value added; one should not expect standard growth models to account for measured GDP in these countries.\nThe second sample excludes countries whose population in 1960 was less than 1 million, or whose real income figures were based on extremely little primary data; measurement error is likely to be a greater problem for these countries. This sample consists of 75 countries.\nThe third sample consists of the 22 OECD countries with population greater than 1 million. This sample has high quality data and the variation in omitted country specific factors is small. A disadvantage is that this sample is small in size.\n\nWe estimate equation (3.1) with and without imposing the constraints that the coefficients on \\(\\log(s)\\) and \\(\\log(n+g+\\delta)\\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. We assume \\(g+\\delta = 0.05\\) because in the US \\(\\delta \\approx 0.03\\) and \\(g \\approx 0.02\\)."

    "text": "Last week, we discovered the OLS estimator and what it does. It allows to assess, under certain conditions, the linear relation between an explained variable \\(y\\) and explanatory variables \\(X\\), using \\(n\\) individual observations.\nRecall that OLS estimator is biased. If the estimator is biased \\(E(\\epsilon|X) \\neq 0\\). Bias may arise in three main cases:\n\nMeasurement error. If the observed value \\(\\tilde{X}\\) of the real variable \\(X\\) is biased, then it writes \\(\\tilde{X} = X + \\mu\\). Then the exogeneity assumption does not hold.\nOmitted variable bias. The true model is \\(y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 z_i + \\epsilon_i\\). If we estimate \\(y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\\), we may under- or over-estimate the effect of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nReverse causality (or simultaneity). The true model is \\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x_i + \\alpha_2 z_i + u_i \\\\\nx_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 y_i + \\beta_2 z_i + v_i\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nRearranging yields a reduced-form model \\(y_i = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 z_i + \\pi_2 x_i + e_i\\), but \\(e_i\\) contains both \\(u_i\\) and \\(z_i\\) and the exogeneity assumption might be violated.",

    "text": "Exercise 2: Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson and instrumental variable\n\nRecap\nIn this very influential paper, AJR estimates the effects of institution on GDP growth. They in particular test whether good institutions, hat protect entrepreneurs, enhance the GDP per capita growth in the African context.\nHowever, there is a clear endogeneity issue. Can you see it?\n\n\nPart 1\n\nDownload the dataset and describe the data\nCreate a scatter plot of mortality rate against GDP per capita in 1995, and a second scatter plot with the log mortality rate and log GDP per capita in 1995. Notice the difference.\n\nTable 2 of Acemoglu et al. (2001) presents the results of an OLS regression of log GDP per capita in 1995 on average protection against expropriation, and a some covariates: \\[\n    \\log y_i = \\mu + \\alpha R_i + \\mathbf{X}_i'\\gamma + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\nIdentify the covariates in the results table.\nReproduce the results for the columns (2), (5), and (6). Export them to your answer sheet. Interpret the results clearly.\nWhat is the effect of an increase of 1 on the risk scale on the GDP?\n\n\n\nPart 2\nSo far, we used OLS to estimate the effect of risk on GDP. However, the relationship is likely to be endogenous. Hence, we can risk with mortality to aleviate this endogeneity concern. We run two different methods:\n\nRun the regression of risk on log mortality (using only latitude as a covariate).\nRun the regression of predicted risk on GDP (using only latitude as a covariate). To do so, you need to estimate the predicted risk based on the previous regression result using the predict function.\n\nA good instrument has to check two assumptions. The first one is the relevance, meaning that the instrument must be correlated with the instrumented variable. The second one is exogeneity, meaning that \\(z\\) must not cause \\(y\\). This cannot be directly tested for.\n\nDoes the instrument seem valid? Comment the results.\nDiscover the function ivreg and do the IV regression again. Do the results differ?",
